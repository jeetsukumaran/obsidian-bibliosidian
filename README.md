# Bibliosidian

Have BibTex, will Obsidian.

Whether you use Zotero, PaperPile, Mendalay, JabRef etc. as your reference manager, or run with Google searches, or are riding the AI wave, all sources can be represented by a BibTeX entry, and all (good) reference managers allow you to export BibTex.

This plugin does not replace any of them.

It supplements them.

It is a *light-weight* alternative to the much heavier (and better-featured) approaches that, for e.g. "talk" directly to Zotero or other applications, and is independent of any particular reference manager, working with all of them (that export BibTeX).

        containerEl.createEl("p", {
            text: "In this system, literature notes are structured into distinct types to enhance clarity and retrieval. Each type serves a specific function in the knowledge network, ensuring that references, verbatim extracts, interpretations, and conceptual integrations are well-organized."
        });

        containerEl.createEl("p", {
            text: "A bibliographical reference note is *about* the reference itself, serving as a structured citation link. It contains standardized metadata such as authors, title, publication year, and source details."
        });

        containerEl.createEl("p", {
            text: "Extract notes contain primary content copied verbatim from the reference. These are direct quotations or important passages that retain the original wording for accurate citation and reference."
        });

        containerEl.createEl("p", {
            text: "Reading notes capture interpretations, summaries, thoughts, and reflections on the content of the reference. These notes facilitate critical engagement with the material and serve as a bridge between the raw source and personal knowledge construction."
        });

        containerEl.createEl("p", {
            text: "Concept notes contain the main structured ideas derived from multiple sources. They include atomic notes (self-contained, discrete ideas), bridging notes (connections between concepts), and other synthesized knowledge elements that integrate insights from various references."
        });



This plugin will then automate the following actions:


## Features

### Automated source reference, author, and reading note creation, updating, and linking

Build and revise your knowledge source networks on-the-go as you update your vault with BibTex data.

The basic workflow starts after you get a BibTeX into your clipboard.
For every BibTeX record imported from your clipboard, this plugin will create or update:

- A "bibliographic note" for the reference, serving as a hub or anchor for indexing, mentioning, or linking to the source.
- For each author, an "author note" is also created, with metadata links to the bibliographic note and vice versa.
- An optional "extracts" note can be created at the same time, also linked to the bibliographic note and vica versa: here is where verbatim cut and pastes, images/figures, tables from the source note go
- An optional "reading" note can be created at the same time, also linked to the bibliographic note and vica versa: here is where actual notes on the source are taken

#### Relationship to classical Zettelkasten notes

In a classical Zettelkasten system, a **literature note** is a single note summarizing key ideas, arguments, and insights from a source. However, in this system, the literature note is decomposed into multiple specialized notes, each serving a distinct function and enhancing link granularity and content provenance.

##### 1. **Bibliographic note**
   - Equivalent to the traditional literature note's metadata section but structured as a standalone entity.
   - Serves as an anchor for indexing, referencing, and linking to the source across the system.
   - Contains citation details and is bidirectionally linked to all derived notes.
   - Enhances discoverability by enabling direct connections to authors and extracted content.

##### 2. **Author notes**
   - Introduce a modular approach to tracking intellectual lineage.
   - Unlike classical Zettelkasten, where authorship is often just a reference within a note, these separate notes create dedicated identity nodes for authors, linking them explicitly to their works.
   - Facilitate connections across multiple works by the same author, allowing for higher-level synthesis of their contributions.

##### 3. **Extracts note**
   - Functionally similar to the verbatim excerpts that might exist within a literature note but given their own dedicated space.
   - Separates direct quotations, figures, and tables from interpretative or synthesized content.
   - Improves citation accuracy and content provenance by preventing unintentional conflation of direct excerpts with analysis.

##### 4. **Reading note**
   - Represents the core analytical function of a literature note but detached from direct excerpts.
   - Contains synthesized insights, connections to other works, and critical reflections.
   - Benefits from structural independence by allowing annotations and synthesis to evolve without being cluttered by raw extracts.

### Source holdings import and integration

This plugin also relieves you some of the busy work of integrating an external PDF into your note graph by providing an import service:

- Renaming the imported file to match the (base) filename of the active file (assumed to be a reference note, o otherwise, a note you want to associate with the imported file), and copying it into the vault into a (customizable) subdirectory.
- Adding a link to the newly imported file to the active file's frontmatter YAML metadata.

### Generate citation list from outlinked or inlinked properties

A list of citations (``[@citekey]``) can be generated based on reference notes either linking to or being linked from the current note.

## Installation

Until the package is not available on the Obsidian community store, you will need
to clone the repository and build it yourself.

1. You need to have the following installed:

    - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
    - [git](https://git-scm.com/)

2. Open the `.obsidian/plugins/` folder of your vault in a system shell or terminal.
   You can get here directly in the terminal or otherwise have Obsidian help you:
	- You will need to enable "Community Plugins" for this to work.
	- Open the settings panel in Obsidian, and navigate to the Plugins section
	- Enable community plugins and then click "open plugins folder".
	- Open a terminal window in this folder.
3. Run: `git clone git@github.com:jeetsukumaran/obsidian-bibliosidian.git`
4. Run: `npm i`
5. Run: `npm run build`
6. Enable the plugin from the "Community Plugins" settings page

This will produce a `main.js` file inside the repository folder, which Obsidian can open and make use of directly.
There's nothing else you need to do.
